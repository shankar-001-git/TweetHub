User Authentication: Create and manage accounts with login and registration capabilities.
Tweet Management: Post, edit, and delete tweets, similar to Twitterâ€™s tweeting features.
Social Interactions: Follow and unfollow users to customize your feed.
Timeline: View and interact with a dynamic feed of tweets from followed users.
Engagement: Like and unlike tweets to show appreciation or disinterest.

## Features
User Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles.

##Technology Stack
